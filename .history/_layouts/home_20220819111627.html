								    <h2> Brief bio </h2>
							
								    <p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research-area/personal-health-informatics/">Personal Health Informatics</a> at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer and Information Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences.
									    I am also:<br>
									    - the <a href="https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/computational-data-science-fellowships/2017-fellowship-winners">ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences</a> fellow,<br>
									    - the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-ag-20-009.html">NIH National Institute of Aging</a> fellow (F99/K00).<br>
                      <br>Having master’s degrees in Economics from <a href="https://www.barcelonagse.eu/scientific-council">Barcelona Graduate School of Economics</a> and in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science from the University of Michigan</a>, I apply my interdisciplinary expertise to creating individualized, closed-loop, computational behavior models for novel health technologies, specifically for marginalized, underrepresented populations, and older adults. </br>

                      <br>
											I spend most days on computationally modeling human behavior using mechanistic models grounded in cognitive psychology and psychiatry.
                      <br>
											<br>
											You will most often see me writing Python and R code.
											<br>
											<br>
											<b>Interests</b><br>
											- Academically, I am interested in extending healthspan and amplifying cognition through technology-enabled interventions and scientific discovery. <br>

											- Professionally, I focus on applying methods from HCI and computational sciences to provide interpretable and actionable insight into user behavior.<br><br>
										
											<b>Updates</b><br>
											- August 2022: I am looking for volunteers with experience in Python or Kotlin to join my team in developing digital biomarkers of cognitive health using smartphone data. If you are interested in gaining hands-on experience in data science, ML and software engineering, please contact me via LinkedIn or email. We are a 100% remote team. <br>
											- July 2022: Do you live in the greater Boston area and are aged 45-65? If yes, consider enrolling in my <a href="https://www.cognition.nu">paid research project ($500) focused on monitoring changes in memory and attention</a>. For more information, visit: <a href="https://www.cognition.nu">cognition.nu</a>. <br>
											- May 2022: I completed my comprehensive exam and <u>will be on the job market in May 2023</u>. <br>
											- March 2020: I joined <a href="https://www.mobs-lab.org/2019ncov.html">the MOBS lab</a>, where I contribute to the <a href="https://covid19.gleamproject.org/mobility">modeling of SARS-COV-2 / COVID-19 spread</a> using large-scale mobility data. <br>
