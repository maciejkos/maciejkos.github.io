                    <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
                </header>
                <p> I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://cbh.northeastern.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at Northeastern University. 
                    <!-- I am also affiliated with the <a href="https://www.bumc.bu.edu/pbhi/">Precision Brain Health Initiative</a> at Boston University Medical School, Dept. of Anatomy and Neurobiology.  -->
                                                              
                <br><br>My current work is funded by the NIH NIA K00 Career Award. Previously, I was funded by <a href="https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/computational-data-science-fellowships/2017-fellowship-winners">ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences Fellowship</a> and Google Scholarship.

                <br><br>In 2024, I received my Ph.D. in <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research-area/personal-health-informatics/">Personal Health Informatics</a> from Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences and BouvÃ© College of Health Sciences.	I also hold graduate degrees in Economics from <a href="https://www.barcelonagse.eu/scientific-council">Barcelona Graduate School of Economics</a> and in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science from the University of Michigan</a>.

                        <br><br><b>Interests:</b>
                        <br>- Academically, I am interested in extending healthspan and amplifying cognition through technology-enabled interventions and scientific discovery. I specialize in mHealth technologies, passive sensing, and behavioral modeling. Building on my background in computer science, behavioral economics, and information science, I combine data-driven and statistical approaches with computational mechanistic modeling and decision-making frameworks to address challenges in health monitoring, cognitive aging, and physical activity interventions across populations.

                        <br>- When working with industry partners, I focus on applying methods from computational and behavioral sciences to provide interpretable and actionable insight into user behavior.

                        <br><br>I welcome collaborations on meaningful projects and enjoys mentoring students. If you'd like to explore working together, please reach out to me.
