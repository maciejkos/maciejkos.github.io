                    <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://cbh.northeastern.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at Northeastern University.</p>

                <p>In 2024, I received my Ph.D. in Personal Health Informatics from Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I also hold graduate degrees in Economics from the Barcelona Graduate School of Economics and in Information Science from the University of Michigan.</p>

                <p>My research is driven by the goal of extending healthspan and enhancing cognitive performance through technology-enabled interventions. Integrating approaches from computer science, behavioral economics, and information science, I specialize in:</p>

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>mHealth technologies</li>
                    <li>Passive sensing</li>
                    <li>Behavioral modeling</li>
                    <li>Computational mechanistic modeling</li>
                    <li>Decision-making frameworks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These methods help me tackle challenges in health monitoring, cognitive aging, and physical activity interventions across diverse populations.</p>
