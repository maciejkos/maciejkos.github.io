                <header><h2>Brief Bio</h2></header>

                <p>My name is Maciej Kos. <br>
					I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the <a href="https://cbh.northeastern.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at Northeastern University.</p>

				<h4>Funding</h4>
                <p>My current work is funded by the NIH NIA K00 Career Award. Previously, I was funded by ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences Fellowship and Google Scholarship.</p>
				
				<h4>Education</h4>
                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>Ph.D. in <a href="https://phi.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Personal Health Informatics</a>, Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern Universitys</li>
                    <li>MA in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science, University of Michigan</a></li>
                    <li>MS in Economics of Science and Innovation, <a href="https://bse.eu/">Barcelona School of Economics</a></li>
                </ul>

                <p>My research is driven by the goal of extending healthspan and enhancing cognitive performance through technology-enabled interventions. Integrating approaches from computer science, behavioral economics, and information science, I specialize in:</p>

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>mHealth technologies</li>
                    <li>Passive sensing</li>
                    <li>Behavioral modeling</li>
                    <li>Computational mechanistic modeling</li>
                    <li>Decision-making frameworks</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These methods help me tackle challenges in health monitoring, cognitive aging, and physical activity interventions across diverse populations.</p>
