                <p>My name is Maciej Kos. <br>
				My research is driven by the goal of extending healthspan and amplifying cognitive performance through technology-enabled interventions and scientific discovery</p>
				<p>I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://cbh.northeastern.edu/">Center for Cognitive and Brain Health</a> at Northeastern University.</p>
				

				<h4>Funding</h4>
				<ul class="alt">
                    <li>Currently, I am funded by the <b>NIH NIA K00 Career Award</b>.</li>
                    <li>Previously, I was funded by:
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences Fellowship</li>
							<li>Google Scholarship</li>
						</ul>
                </ul>
				
				<h4>Education</h4>
                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>Ph.D. in <a href="https://phi.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Personal Health Informatics</a>, Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University</li>
                    <li>MA in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science, University of Michigan</a></li>

                </ul>

				<h4>Research Interests</h4>
                <p>Building on my background in computer science, behavioral economics, and information science, I combine data-driven and statistical approaches with computational mechanistic modeling and decision-making frameworks. I apply this integrated approach to address challenges in health monitoring, mitigating cognitive aging, and enhancing lifestyle-based interventions across populations through advancing digital and personal health research. I specialize in:</p>

                <ul class="alt">
                    <li>mHealth technologies</li>
                    <li>Passive sensing</li>
