<p><span>Hi everyone,</span><br /><br /><span>Two weeks ago, I mentioned that I might need to attend a conference on Wednesday, Oct 16. Most of you indicated that you would be able to meet on Thursday, Oct 17, instead (same classroom, same time: 5:15 pm). (Thank you!)</span><br /><br /><span><strong>If you&rsquo;re unavailable on Oct 17, could you please email me by Monday? </strong>If I don&rsquo;t hear from you, I&rsquo;ll assume that you&rsquo;re able to attend on Oct 17.</span><br /><br /><span>Here are the details to make it easy:</span><br /><br /><span><strong>Email: </strong>mkos@ccs.neu.edu</span><br /><span><strong>Subject: </strong>[DS 2001; 14290]: I can&rsquo;t come on Oct 17.</span><br /><span><strong>Body:</strong> Sorry, I can&rsquo;t come on Oct 17. (No explanation needed!)</span></p>
<p><br /><span>I&rsquo;ll confirm whether we are moving the class from Oct 16 to Oct 17 class date next week.</span><br /><br /><span>Thanks, and I hope the mini-exam went well!</span><br /><br /><span>Best,</span><br /><span>&mdash; Maciej</span></p>
