<h2>DS2001: Data Science Programming Practicum</h2>
<p>I'm thrilled to teach DS2001: Data Science Programming Practicum this Fall. This course offers a very gentle introduction to Python and data science, perfect for undergraduates with no prior programming or math experience. My goal is to make this one of the most empowering classes you'll take. We'll focus on practical programming skills and problem-solving techniques that will not only help you excel in DS2000 but also succeed in our areas of your life. </p>

<p> ðŸš€ This class is a safe space for beginners. Mistakes are not only expected but cherished as they lead to insight and learning. ðŸš€</p>

<p>What makes this class unique is the emphasis on developing crucial programming and engineering skills. In addition to Python, you'll learn Iterative Development, Problem Decomposition, Algorithmic Thinking, and Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys) - tools that will help you overcome challenges and troubleshoot problems effectively. These skills are tailored to help you ace the DS2000 (corequisite) exams and excel in your homework.</p>

<p>Our classes will be highly interactive, featuring hands-on problems, pair programming, and engaging exercises. Through these methods, you'll build a solid foundation in data science. The highlight is a month-long group project where you'll apply your new skills to real-world data challenges of your choosing. I'm committed to your success, offering plenty of support during class, office hours, and beyond.</p>

<p>While my other section has already filled up, <b>there are still seats available in the Thursday evening section from 5:15-6:55 PM in West Village H 210A (CRN: 14295)</b>.
