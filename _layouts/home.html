								    <h2> Brief bio </h2>
								    <p> I am a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research-area/personal-health-informatics/">Personal Health Informatics</a> at Northeastern University’s Colleges of Computer and Information Science and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I am also an <a href="http://www.sighpc.org/fellowships/2017">ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences fellow.</a><br>
                      <br>Having master’s degrees in Economics from <a href="https://www.barcelonagse.eu/scientific-council">Barcelona Graduate School of Economics</a> and in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science from the University of Michigan</a>, I apply my interdisciplinary expertise to creating individualized, closed-loop, computational behavior models for novel health technologies, specifically targeting marginalized and underrepresented populations. </br>

                      <br>
                      I spend most days modeling human behavior in R/Python and working for <a href="https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/sharp">an IARPA project</a> focused on improving fluid intelligence using games and brain stimulation.

                      <br>
                      <br>
                      <strong>I am currently looking for a paid data science internship in the Greater Boston area for the summer or fall of 2019.</strong>
