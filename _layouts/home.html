								    <h2> Brief bio </h2>
								    <p> I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/research-area/personal-health-informatics/">Personal Health Informatics</a> at Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer and Information Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. I am also an <a href="https://www.sighpc.org/for-your-career/computational-data-science-fellowships/2017-fellowship-winners">ACM/Intel Corporation Computational and Data Sciences fellow.</a><br>
                      <br>Having master’s degrees in Economics from <a href="https://www.barcelonagse.eu/scientific-council">Barcelona Graduate School of Economics</a> and in <a href="https://www.si.umich.edu/">Information Science from the University of Michigan</a>, I apply my interdisciplinary expertise to creating individualized, closed-loop, computational behavior models for novel health technologies, specifically for marginalized, underrepresented populations, and older adults. </br>

                      <br>
											I spend most days on computationally modeling human behavior using mechanistic models grounded in cognitive psychology and psychiatry.
                      <br>
											<br>
											You will most often see me writing Python and R code.
											<br>
											<br>
											Interests:<br>
											- Professionally, I focus on applying methods from HCI and computational sciences to provide interpretable and actionable insight into user behavior.<br>
											- Academically, I am interested in extending healthspan and amplifying cognition through technology-enabled interventions and scientific discovery. <br>

											<br>
											<br>
											<i><b>I am currently looking for a summer 2020 data science, research, or UX research internship. </b></i>
