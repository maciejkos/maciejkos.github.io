<h3>Evidence-based treatment for alexithymia using wearables</h3>
<p>Alexithymia is the inability to identify, recognize, describe emotions and distinguish between feelings and physical manifestations of emotional arousal. Approximately, <b>13.5% of general population</b> and nearly <b>30% of older adults suffer from alexithymia</b>. Currently, there exist no evidence-based treatment for this condition.

<p><a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/people/stefan-olaffson/">Stefán Ólafsson</a> and I decided to design a working prototype which helps stimulate brain's anterior insular cortex by asking patients simple questions throughout the day. Insufficient development of this brain area is hypothesized to cause alexithymia.</p>
