<h3>Heart rate data cleaning algorithm for wearables</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://www.ccis.northeastern.edu/people/misha-pavel/">PhD advisor</a> and I developed and evaluated a novel algorithm for cleaning heart rate data captured by wearable devices.</p>

<p>Our algorithm improves data quality (concordance correlation coefficient) by 14.4% outperforming Microsoft's solution. One unique feature of the algorithm is its ability to remove motion artifacts without accessing any motion data.</p>
