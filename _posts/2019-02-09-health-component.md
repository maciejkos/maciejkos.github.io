<li><strong>Paper title</strong>: Dual-task tests: differences and changes in motor function in persons with varying levels of cognitive impairment – a systematic review</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: Dementia is one of the key public challenges of this century with the number of persons with dementia worldwide projected to reach 115 million by 2050. Emerging research on the mirroring of changes in cognitive capacity in motor function may enable early detection of dementia. The goal of this review was to assess the evidence about differences in motor parameters under dual-task conditions among persons with varying levels of cognitive impairment. The author conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed articles published between January 1970 and October 2017 that were found by querying PubMed. To be included, studies needed to provide quantitative assessments of cognitive and motor functions, use dual-task tests and be performed by at least two groups of individuals with distinct levels of cognitive ability. After screening 221 retrieved abstracts, the author fully-reviewed 24 articles, of which 12 are included in this review. Gait speed during dual-task tests and gait speed dual-task cost differ between healthy individuals and persons with cognitive impairment. Such differences do not exist between patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. More studies are needed to make meaningful conclusions about other motor parameters and performance on the “Timed Up and Go” test. Differences and changes in gait speed under dual-task conditions suggest that monitoring of this parameter may be used in dementia screening. Harmonization of results, a stronger focus on ecological validity, and the introduction of novel analytical methods are needed to increase the quality of evidence and ensure its clinical relevance.</li>
<li><b>A paragraph description of the exam topic and why it was selected</b>:
<p>As cognitive impairment is becoming the key public health change we need new scalable health management strategies and ways for evaluating behavioral and pharmacological interventions; this necessities development of novel ecologically valid cognitive assessment methods. Understanding of the degree to which motor function parameters can be relied upon in this context will inform whether we can use unobtrusive motor function sensors (e.g., accelerometers) to create technologies for passively assessing cognitive function over time.</p></li>
<li><b>The name and title of the faculty examiner, and why that individual was selected</b>:
<ul>
<li><i>Name</i>: Jane Saczynski</li>
<li><i>Title</i>: Associate Professor, Department of Pharmacy and Health Systems Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Northeastern University</li>
<li><i>Justification</i>: Professor Saczynski is a well-published expert in the areas of cognitive function, dementia and delirium with training in Psychiatric Epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Neuro-Epidemiology at the National Institute on Aging. She published multiple papers on the assessment of cognitive function including studies which used motor parameters in estimating the degree of impairment. Professor Saczynski was, therefore, highly qualified to properly evaluate my exam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>A description of how the exam was structured, and why (e.g., literature review)</b>:
<p>The exam took the form of a systematic literature review as per the recommendation in the PHI doctoral handbook. I participated in Professor Saczynski’s class “PHTH 6450: Systematic Reviews of Scientific Literature” where I submitted and subsequently revised sections of the review as class assignments. To ensure the review met the criteria of the qualifying exam, I discussed the criteria with Professor Saczynski. Furthermore, the research questions to be answered in the review were mutually agreed upon by both Professor Saczynski and Professor Pavel (my advisor). Professor Saczynski provided feedback on the document during the class and my individual meetings with her as well officially reviewed the exam.</p></li>
