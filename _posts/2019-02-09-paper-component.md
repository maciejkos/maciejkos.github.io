<li><b>Paper title</b>: Can accelerometry data improve estimates of heart rate variability from wrist pulse PPG sensors?</li>
<li><b>Abstract</b>: A key prerequisite for precision medicine is the ability to assess metrics of human behavior objectively, unobtrusively and continuously. This capability serves as a framework for the optimization of tailored, just-in-time precision health interventions. Mobile unobtrusive physiological sensors, an important prerequisite for realizing this vision, show promise in implementing this quality of physiological data collection. However, first we must trust the collected data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to improving heart rate estimates from wrist pulse photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. We also discuss the impact of sensor movement on the veracity of collected heart rate data.</li>

<li><b>Statement from the student’s advisor</b>: This paper describes a novel approach to the inference of instantaneous heart rate from wrist-worn sensors contaminated by movement-related artifacts. The paper was accepted and presented at the 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC). EMBC is one of the top Biomedical Engineering conferences with an h-index of 13 as of 2014. Maciej played the key role in designing the experiment, ensuring proper data collection infrastructure and integrity. He independently cleaned and analyzed the data. He evaluated the results, deploying a variety of statistical techniques, and led manuscript preparation including writing the vast majority of the paper and incorporating feedback provided by other authors earning him first authorship. Finally, he oversaw the submission and review processes. I strongly believe this exemplifies Maciej’s ability to produce impactful, publishable work.</li>
