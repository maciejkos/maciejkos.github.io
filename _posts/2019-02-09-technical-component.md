<li><strong>Paper title</strong>: Intensive care unit of the future: health informatics technologies for preventing critical illness brain injury in the ICU</li>
<li><strong>Abstract</strong>: This document contains proposals for the development of the following health informatics systems with applications in the prevention of critical illness brain injury in intensive care units (ICU): (1) a clinical decision support system for sedation choice and management, (2) a patient-centric system for sleep efficacy improvement and care organization, (3) and a clinical decision support system for patient extubation. The development of each proposal was based on:
<ol>
<li>	literature reviews of a) ICU technologies including sensing and treatment delivery modalities, their limitations, and use cases; b) ICU health informatics systems and algorithms for knowledge creation based on sensing technologies; c) relevant health literature including cognitive impairment in the ICU and following ICU treatment, their causes, diagnosis, risk factors, treatments, and recovery trajectories;</li>
<li>	stakeholder analysis, needs assessments, preference elicitations, workflow analyses based on interviews with stakeholders and literature reviews;</li>
<li>	interviews with clinicians, intensivists, nurses, ICU survivors, scientists, and developers as well as their public testimonies and accounts present in the literature;</li>
<li>	critical care data analysis using public and proprietary datasets;</li>
<li>	market analysis of relevant sensing technologies and health informatics systems using sensor data offered by Philips (the primary stakeholder) and its competitors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each proposal includes selected key insights from the aforementioned analyses accompanied by descriptions of systems architecture, data flow diagrams, and graphical user interface prototypes. The described systems represent a subset of all considered technologies. Their selection was based on technical feasibility, potential impact, alignment with the primary stakeholder’s core competencies and business strategy.</p>

<li><b>A paragraph description of the exam topic and why it was selected</b>:
<p>
My advisor, Professor Misha Pavel, and I believe that health informaticians need a strong understanding of both ambulatory and clinical settings to produce impactful PHI research. As the qualifying exam was designed to provide doctoral students with an opportunity to increase doctoral students’ exposure to new points of view, we have decided to focus the technical component of the exam on learning more about clinical health informatics and relevant technologies (clinical sensors, electronic health records, decision support systems and associated algorithms) in the broad context of dissertation research, i.e., cognitive impairment. Therefore, the exam is centered at critical illness brain injury (CIBI) which refers to cognitive impairments suffered by up to 78% intensive care survivors. In the document, I review relevant literature and propose technologies aimed at decreasing the prevalence of CIBI. In addition to insights that are directly applicable to critical care settings, the document may prove valuable to personal health informaticians as the spectrum of care for CIBI patients should extend beyond hospital walls. One approach that could be applicable to tracking patients’ recovery trajectories over time is described in the health component of my qualifying exam.

<li><b>The name and title of the faculty examiner, and why that individual was selected</b>:
<ul>
<li><i>Name</i>:Holly B. Jimison</li>
<li><i>Title</i>:Professor of the Practice, Khoury College of Computer Sciences and Bouvé College of Health Science, Northeastern University</li>
<li><i>Justification</i>:Professor Jimison has made significant and sustained contributions to the field of biomedical informatics in the areas of pattern recognition, decision support, and health informatics. Professor Jimison published multiple papers on modeling cognitive impairment and cognitive training. Furthermore, she is an expert in developing algorithms that utilize large amounts of sensor data to infer clinically relevant variables. I believe Professor Jimison’s expertise highly qualifies her to review the quality of my technical exam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>A description of how the exam was structured, and why (e.g., literature review)</b>:
<p>
The exam took the form of a literature review (as per the recommendation in the PHI doctoral handbook) augmented by interviews with stakeholders and relevant experts as well as a data analytics component. Consistent with Northeastern University’s emphasis on experiential learning, the exam’s requirements were developed and evaluation performed in collaboration with an industry partner during my internship at Philips Healthcare Research. To ensure the exam met the criteria of the qualifying exam, the criteria were agreed upon by dr. Daniel Schulman (Senior Scientist at Philips Healthcare Research), Professor Pavel (my advisor), and Professor Jimison. Dr. Schulman and Professor Jimison provided feedback on the document which I continuously implemented.
